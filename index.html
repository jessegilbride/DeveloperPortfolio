							<h2>About Me</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I graduated with a BS in Computer Engineering from Wentworth IT (Boston, MA) and while I excelled and enjoyed my education greatly, the job market after the economic crash of 2008 left me seeking a career that allowed me to be more creative and hopefully recession-proof. So I embarked on becoming a Front End Web Developer by learning as much as I could through books, web tutorials, and peeking at what other great devs have done (via the browser's code inspector, of course).</p>
						<p>After five years of working in the field, though, I found that it was getting very difficult to pick up certain skills that are crucial for today's web developers to be marketable and successful, which led me <a href="https://www.thinkful.com">Thinkful</a>. I'm very excited to discover what amazing things I will build as I go through the coursework. As time progresses, I will add those works (or links to them) on this site for all to see.</p>
						<p>I have worked as both freelancer and team member at several companies and love the process and working with others. If you need any work done or want to consider a collaboration, please reach out. You can find me via the <a href="#contact">contact links</a> below.</p>
						<p>Beyond web development, my other interest include:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>weight lifting (mostly powerlifting) and conditioning</li>
							<li>learning cosmological physics</li>
							<li>singing karaoke</li>
							<li>playing guitar</li>
							<li>cooking (breakfasts and dinners)</li>
							<li>making awesome lattes</li>
						</ul>
